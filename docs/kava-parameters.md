---

<a id="bufferTimeSum"></a>`bufferTimeSum` - Sum of all the buffer time during all the playback.

- Can be 0 to ∞.
  - Should be in format of float (second.milliSecond).
  - New media entry will reset this value.
  - `VIEW` event that was not sent for 30 seconds also reset this value.

---

<a id="actualBitrate"></a>`actualBitrate` - The bitrate of the displayed video track in kbps.

- When ABR mode selected manually - value should be 0.
  - In `SOURCE_SELECTED` event should be equal to the manually selected video bitrate.
  - In `FLAVOUR_SWITCH` event should be based on ABR selection and equal to the currently selected bitrate by ABR.

---
